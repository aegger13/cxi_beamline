class NS_Timing(object):
    ''' Class that defines a timing channel of a DG645 delay generator.
        It uses an epics PV that is the value of the offset, so that timings
        can be given with respect to a reference. For example, the ns laser
        timing would be specified with respect to a t0, which is when the
        of the laser and the x-rays coincide.
        Since most users think of delaying the X-rays with respect to the
        laser, positive delays pull the laser trigger earlier.
        So:
        The offset is the value on the DG645 box that corresponds to zero delay
        The delay = offset - Value_on_DG645
        The delay is also written to an epics pv whenever it is written or read
